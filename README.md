# The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges

## Alex Craig - 2025

### Goals:

- Try implementing as much of the cryptography challenges in Golang as possible as a learning exercise.

- Recreate most crypto functions such as AES to have a better understanding of it (where it makes sense to).

- Only use standard library
